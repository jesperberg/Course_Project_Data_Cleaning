The project assignment was the following 5 steps:


1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


I began by reading all the train, and test files. In the script you can easily follow the steps I have made in order
to complete this assignment.

1. After reading in the tables, I merged them in order to create one data set to work with.

2. I created a logical vector with the information TRUE or FALSE wether the column name had the string I searched for (mean, std).

3. I merged my data set with my selected measurements and merged it in order to get the activity name for my data set.

4. By using a for-loop I could then iterate through all the column names and re-name them into something more descriptive and easily read.

5. I summarized my final data set in order to get the average per activity type and subject. This summarized (average of each activity type
and subject), became my final, tidy data set which was exported.
